Path2Coder's Solana Hackfest Afterthought:
```
For our first hackathon, we created SolSummoner for the hackathon. Please remember that we thought of the idea at the last minute and we managed to finish it within the time.
Of course, we were not happy with the outcome but not too sad about it either. This hackathon taught us a lot, and we know what to do next time.

Anyway, that is about it. We want to express our feelings honestly.
